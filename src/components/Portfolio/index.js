              to finally build this project was a rewarding experiencing! There are a plethora of skincare routines on the Internet,

              Being able to retrieve all of the financial data we needed made it much easier than having to seed data into our database.
              I really enjoyed creating the stock performance graphs in which you can toggle around and view the different prices depending on the day. The graphs
              also alter between colors pink and green based on the performance of the stock over time."

              were times where I was unsure of how to query for data on the backend since Flask/SQLAlchemy were
              still new to me. Referencing the documentation and asking my teammates helped me immensely in these instances."

              displaying images from various users. I found that when styling using grid or flexbox, some photos 
              would have extra whitespace depending on the size of the image. I researched guides and suggestions on how to 
              create a seamless grid view of images. There were a lot of resources online and I gathered a few ideas that I could try implementing.
              After trial and error of writing several different CSS declarations, I was finally able to create a 
              photo grid using columns set to a certain width. It took some time but using my resources helped me achieve my visual goal for this project."
